# Statement Of Purpose
Add your TO-DO's and complete them....

The TO-do-list is an app used to know either we did a To-do or not.

This app used to customize the To-do's on particular day that means we can add or delete them.

# Project Vision
We could like to create a progerssive web application that can be played in any mobile device.
The app would encourage it uses to complete a 'To-Do' by giving specefic task per day.
This app has a number of great features which makes it ideal for keeping track routines.

This app has a number of great features which makes it ideal for keeping track of habits and routines. Used together, you’ll be able to develop your list with ease. If you’re falling behind, the app will send you a reminder, and keep you on target.

If you’re looking for inspiration, the application comes with over pre-designed habits to get you started. One of the most appealing things is the beautifully designed and eye catching interface.

The app is quick and easy to use, so you’ll be able to start developing great To-do list right away. If you plan to complete a set number of tasks for a specific date, the app calculates if you’re on track to complete it on time.

When day starts...

User gets some pre-defined To-do's which we have added previously.
Some To-do's can be customized on date which reminds user to complete within the time.
The completation of To-do's gives credit to the user which motivates him to be healthy with ease.

# Functional Requirements

1. Administrator(access to all information including app settings)

If the details entered are correct, the page is redirected to admin panel.
